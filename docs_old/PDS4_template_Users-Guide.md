# [Overview of the Cartography Discipline Data Dictionary](#overview)

# [Organization of Classes and Attributes](#organization)

*Give a schematic diagram or a list showing the hierarchy of
classes in order of appearance in label. Refer the reader to the Definitions
section for complete definitions. An example of such a list is given on the
page [Filling Out The Spectral Dictionary Classes](http://sbndev.astro.umd.edu/wiki/Filling_Out_the_Spectral_Dictionary_Classes#.3CCircular_FOV.3E)
on the PDS Small Bodies Node wiki. In this example the names of classes and attributes have hyperlinks to
their definitions further down the page, a useful lookup tool.*

*The author should take into consideration the complexity
of the dictionary when organizing this section.  If the hierarchy is large or
complicated, it may be helpful to break it down by class as shown in the
following subsections, but don’t forget to provide a high-level view of how the
classes relate to one another.*
