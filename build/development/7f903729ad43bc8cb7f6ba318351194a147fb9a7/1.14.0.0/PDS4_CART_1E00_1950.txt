    Contains classes and attributes used to describe cartographic
    products.  This information is largely adapted from the Federal Geographic 
    Data Committee (FGDC) "Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata", 
    with extensions (changes/additions) to satisfy planetary requirements.

    ## CHANGE LOG ##
    1.9.0.0
    - Upgraded to v1900 of the IM
    - Created new Map_Projection_Lander class with associated map projections and attributes
    - New pixel_scale attribute that defines a pixel scale not x/y aligned
    - Change units for pixel_scale_x/y to Units_of_Pixel_Scale_Map
    - Change units for pixel_resolution_x/y to Units_of_Pixel_Resolution_Map
    - Change local_georeference_information to optional in the case where Map_Projection_Lander is specified.
    - Created Local_child_check rule to check this
    - Change Spatial_Domain to optional in the case where Map_Projection_Lander is specified since domain is the horizon
    - Created spatial_domain_or_lander_check rule to check this
    - Added Local_Internal_Reference at top-level of Cartography dictionary
    - Created local_reference_type_check_cart rule to enforce value of Local_Internal_Reference
    
    1.9.0.1
    - Changed all class local_identifier to identifier_reference per v1900 IM update
    - Changed Coordinate_Space_Reference to inherit from Geometry dictionary
    
    1.9.0.2
    - CIsbell 24July2018
    - Added/corrected unit_of_measure_type where appropriate to correctly include 
      'Units_of_Pixel_Scale_Map' and 'Units_of_Pixel_Resolution_Map'
    
    1.9.1.0
    - Added Point Perspective Map Projection (CIsbell).
    - Note: As of 24July2018, parameters/attributes here include only those required to define the 'fundamental' Point Perspective (PP)
        Projection. That is, along with the common base projection parameters required for all projections, the additional PP
        requirements of target_center_distance and nadir point (longitude_of_central_meridian, latitude_of_projection_origin) 
        will define the basic PP projection. Additional parameters for a more 'complex' PP (line/sample sub-spacecraft offsets
        optical offsets, focal parameters, image array segment definitions, etc, will need to be added as needed.

    1.9.1.1
    - CDeCesare 20181116
    - Removed definitions of classes which are already defined by GEOM dictionary: Vector_Cartesian_Unit_Base, Vector_Cartesian_Position_Base, Vector_Cartesian_No_Units
    - Updated references that point at Vector_Cartesian_Unit_Base to instead point at geom.Vector_Cartesian_Unit
    - Updated references that point at Vector_Cartesian_Position_Base to instead point at geom.Vector_Cartesian_Position_Base

    1.9.2.0
    PGeissler and THare 20181221
    - Added Oblique Cylindrical Map Projection 
    - Note: To support Cassini BIDR. This is a somewhat specialize map projection which requires several new projection parameters
            including: reference_latitude, reference_longitude, map_projection_rotation, oblique_proj_pole_latitude, 
			oblique_proj_pole_longitude, oblique_proj_pole_rotation, oblique_proj_x_axis_vector, oblique_proj_y_axis_vector, and
			oblique_proj_z_axis_vector. The original parameter center_latitude is now mapped to latitude_of_projection_origin and
			the original parameter center_longitude is now mapped to longitude_of_central_meridian. line, sample offsets are
			remapped into meters using upperleft_corner_x and upperleft_corner_y. 
    - Added many definitions for map projections (cartographic and lander). 
    - Removed "General Vertical Near-sided Projection" since it has functionally been replaced by "Point Perspective".

    1.9.3.0
    THare and PGeissler 20190424
    - 'Planar_Coordinate_Information' is no longer mandated to better support vector files. It should be added for images
    - 'cart.latitude_resolution' and 'cart:longitude_resolution' to be optional, not needed for vector GIS labels
    - Added Secondary_Spatial_Domain as an optional or alternative method to list IAU recommended or historically used 
      bounding coordinate section to support both positive East and positive West systems in the same label.
    - Rename all three radius parameter names. These were renamed to clarify the parameter names since the name 
        semi_major_radius is flawed and confusing as semi and radius both mean "half". This keyword should have
        originally been named semi_major_axis (as used by the Federal Geospatial Data Consortium [FGDC]). To better
        align with PDS version 3, we are moving these parameters names back to a_axis_radius, b_axis_radius, and 
        c_axis_radius. Thus we are renaming: 
    - semi_major_radius to a_axis_radius. 
    - semi_minor_radius to b_axis_radius
    - polar_radius to c_axis_radius
      To be clear, most mapping applications call a_axis_radius the semi_major_axis and c_axis_radius the semi_minor_radius.
      The b_axis_radius value is generally not seen in mapping applications which typical do not support triaxial definitions
      for map projections. For most all cases, when a triaxial definition is defined, the IAU defines a best fit sphere. 
      see: https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/groups/IAU-WGCCRE.
      When a best-fit sphere or a body is already defined as a sphere, a single radius value will be listed across all three 
      parameters a_axis_radius, b_axis_radius, and c_axis_radius. For an ellipse, the a_axis_radius and b_axis_radius will be
      defined by a single radius value and a different (generally smaller) radius value for the c_axis_radius. Lastly, the
      default units for the these parameters was set to meters "m".

    THare and CDeCesare 20190430
    - Upgraded to v1B10 of IM.
    - Undid changes from 1.9.1.1.
    - Coordinate_Space_Reference is now re-used from the GEOM class as-is, so that CART doesn't need to re-implement it.

    THare 20190520
    - simple misspellings
    - updated definitions for Surface_Model_Parameters and Surface_Model_Planar, surface_model_type, 
      Vector_Surface_Ground_Location, Vector_Surface_Normal

    1.9.3.1
    THare and CDeCesare 20190613
    - updated line and sample attributes to allow for non-negate values under Camera_Model_Offset, 
      Pixel_Position_Nadir_Polar, Pixel_Position_Origin  

    1.9.3.2
    THare 20190909
    - add Ring section, Map_Projection_Rings, for ring map projections to meet conversion of Cassini PDS3 data to PDS4.
    - Rings intially falls under Horizontal_Coordinate_System_Definition using Local (not tied to a surface) and
      enforces the need for a defined Geodetic_Model (body name, radius values, latitude type, and longitude direction).
    - Updated spatial_domain_or_lander_check to spatial_domain_or_lander_or_rings_check rule.

    1.9.3.3
    THare 20191027
    - Removed Map_Projection_Base. This was suppose to be an abstract clss for group liking map projection
      parameters, but there was no good method to group across the current allowable map projections and
      it made it harder to know which map projection required which parameters.
    - Added Orthographic, Mercator, and Lambert Azimuthal Equal-area
    - removed straight_vertical_longitude_from_pole, just use longitude_of_central_meridian (aka Longitude of 
      projection center) for polar stereographic which is more normally seen. need to update:
      https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/blob/33a8a0edc764253b582e194d330eec3b83072863/gdal/frmts/pds/pds4dataset.cpp#L2280

    1.9.3.4
    THare 20200127
    - Minor update for Oblique Cylindrical to help define that the XML-odd 3-value vector strings (oblique_proj_x_axis_vector,
      oblique_proj_y_axis_vector, oblique_proj_z_axis_vector) as optional and really for documention purposes.
    - Minor update to Polar Stereographic to make scale_factor_at_projection_origin optional and added documention
      to help clarify that attribute projection.

    1.9.4.0
    THare 20200515
    - Add new class Vector_Projection_Z_Axis_Initial
    - Under Oblique Cylindrical set reference_latitude and reference_longitude as optional. Unfortunately,
      some older PDS3 labels have these two values (and an implied angle always set to zero) instead of using the
      more appropriate values: oblique_proj_pole_latitude, oblique_proj_pole_longitude, oblique_proj_pole_rotation
      Implementations for this map projection on use the later 3 attributes (e.g. ISIS3/4 and PROJ) not reference_*.
      So when older labels only use reference_*, those should be converted to use the 3 oblique_proj_pole_* attributes
      (note it is not a simple mapping, requiring a calculated update to get from reference_* to oblique_proj_pole_*)
    - Removed scale_factor_at_center_line as it is currently not being used anywhere
    - Removed pixel_resolution as pixel_resolution_x and pixel_resolution_y should be used (and it was not used anywhere)
      If square, simply repeat the same value in both pixel_resolution_x and pixel_resolution_y
    - Updated projection_axis_offset to be ASCII_REAL
  
    1.9.5.0
    THare 20201204
    - updates for 1.E.0.0 and 1.F.0.0, adding dictionary_type and building with new GEOM 1E00_1900

   description            The longitude_direction attribute identifies the direction of longitude (e.g. POSITIVE_EAST or POSITIVE_WEST) for a planet. The IAU definition for direction of positive longitude should be adopted: http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/groups/IAU-WGCCRE. Typically, for planets with prograde (direct) rotations, positive longitude direction is to the west. For planets with retrograde rotations, positive longitude direction is to the east. Generally the Positive West longitude_direction is used for planetographic systems and Positive East is used for planetocentric systems. If the data is defined with Spatial_Domain in a manner not recommended by the IAU, there is a optional Secondary_Spatial_Domain section to define a second set of bounding coordinates.

   name                   coordinate_system_type
   version                1.14
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            There are three basic types of coordinate systems: body-fixed rotating, body-fixed non-rotating, and inertial. A body-fixed coordinate system is one associated with the body (e.g., a planet or satellite). The body-fixed system is centered on the body and rotates with the body (unless it is a non-rotating type), whereas an inertial coordinate system is fixed at some point in space. Currently, the PDS has specifically defined two types of body-fixed rotating coordinate systems: planetocentric and planetographic. However, the set of related data elements are modeled such that definitions for other body-fixed rotating coordinate systems, body-fixed non-rotating and inertial coordinate systems can be added as the need arises. Contact a PDS data engineer for assistance in defining a specific coordinate system.

   version                1.14
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The latitude_type attribute defines the type of latitude (planetographic, planetocentric) used within a cartographic product and as reflected in attribute values within associated PDS labels. For planets and satellites, latitude is measured north and south of the equator; north latitudes are designated as positive. The planetocentric latitude is the angle between the equatorial plane and a line from the center of the body. The planetographic latitude is the angle between the equatorial plane and a line that is normal to the body. In summary, both latitudes are equivalent on a sphere (i.e., equatorial radius equal to polar radius); however, they differ on an ellipsoid (e.g., Mars, Earth). For more on latitude_type, please see the IAU publication available here: http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/groups/IAU-WGCCRE

   name                   pixel_resolution_x
   version                1.14
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description             The pixel_resolution_x and pixel_resolution_y attributes indicate the image array pixel resolution (distance/pixel or degree/pixel) relative to the Cartesian (x,y) coordinate system as defined by the map projection. Due to varying properties across different map projections, actual surface distances for an individual pixel may be accurate only at specific location(s) within the image array (e.g. reference latitude or longitude, standard parallels, etc). For most PDS products, x and y resolution values are equal ('square' pixels).

   description             The pixel_resolution_x and pixel_resolution_y attributes indicate the image array pixel resolution (distance/pixel or degree/pixel) relative to the Cartesian (x,y) coordinate system as defined by the map projection. Due to varying properties across different map projections, actual surface distances for an individual pixel may be accurate only at specific location(s) within the image array (e.g. reference latitude or longitude, standard parallels, etc). For most PDS products, x and y resolution values are equal ('square' pixels). The inclusion of both x and y attributes allows for anticipated products where resolution may differ for each axis ('rectangular' pixels).

The inclusion of both x and y attributes allows for anticipated products where scale may differ for each axis ('rectangular' pixels). NOTE1: For presentation of hard-copy maps, a map scale is traditionally expressed as a 'representative fraction' (the ratio of a hard-copy map to the actual subject surface (e.g. 1:250,000, where one unit of measure on the map equals 250,000 of the same unit on the body surface)). This usage is relevant when map/data are presented on hard-copy media (paper, computer screen,etc). When defining pixel scale within a stored image/array context here, we are expressing a ratio between the image array and the actual surface (thus, pixel/degree or pixel/distance units).

   description            Provides the ordinary latitude coordinate of the origin (oblique latitude = oblique longitude = 0) for the oblique coordinate system used to specify the OBLIQUE_CYLIDRICAL projection used in Cassini BIDR. NOTE that whereas some past PDS products may utilize oblique projections defined solely in terms of the REFERENCE_LATITUDE and REFERENCE_LONGITUDE (i.e., with a third defining angle always set to zero), the Cassini BIDRs require the full generality of three nonzero rotation angles. These angles are represented by the keywords OBLIQUE_PROJ_POLE_LATITUDE, OBLIQUE_PROJ_POLE_LONGITUDE, and OBLIQUE_PROJ_POLE_ROTATION. The values of REFERENCE_LATITUDE and REFERENCE_LONGITUDE are consistent with the latter three angles but do not uniquely define the oblique coordinate system on their own.

Unit vector in the direction of the X axis of the oblique coordinate system used in the OBLIQUE_CYLINDRICAL projection, in terms of the X, Y, and Z axes of the standard body-fixed coordinate system. In each system, the X axis points from the body center toward longitude and latitude (0,0) in that system, the Z axis to (0,90), and the Y-axis completes a right-handed set. The OBLIQUE_PROJ_X/Y/Z_AXIS_VECTORS makeup the rows of a rotation matrix that when multiplied on the left of a vector referenced to the standard coordinate system converts it into its equivalent in the oblique coordinate system. This rotation matrix is the product of successively applied rotations by OBLIQUE_PROJ_POLE_LONGITUDE around the Z axis, 90 OBLIQUE_PROJ_POLE_LATITUDE around the once-rotated Y axis, and OBLIQUE_PROJ_POLE_ROTATION around the twice-rotated Z axis.

   description            The value (RIGHT or LEFT) indicates the side of the spacecraft ground-track to which the antenna is pointed for data acquired within this file. The SAR images stored in theBIDR files are always acquired on only one side of the ground track for each Titan pass. This value also indicates from which side the SAR image is illuminated. If the spacecraft images to the left of its ground track (LOOK_DIRECTION=LEFT), the image will be illuminated from the (viewer's) left side, and, conversely, if the spacecraft looks to the right, the illumination will come from the right in the image file. The direction of illumination is critical to interpretation of features in the image.

Here we define latitude_of_projection_origin as mandatory and at CART LDD versoin 1934 have made scale_factor_at_projection_origin optional. For context, these two keywords have the same impact on the final product but are just different ways to define it. Thus, for example in the PROJ library, if both are made available, the latitude_of_projection_origin (+lat_ts) will be used instead of scale_factor_at_projection_origin (+k_0). Note, if you do supply the optional attribute scale_factor_at_projection_origin, the default scale (+k_0) for planetary polar data will mostly likely be set to 1.0.

For in-situ mosaics, the surface model describes the surface upon which input images are projected in order to create a unified point of view in a mosaic. To the extent the surface model does not match the actual surface, parallax errors typically occur at seams between images.

   name                   Vector_Projection_Origin
   description            The Vector_Projection_Origin class specifies the location of the origin of the projection. For Polar and Cylindrical projections, this is the XYZ point from which all the azimuth/elevation rays emanate. For the Cylindrical-Perspective projection, this defines the center of the circle around which the synthetic camera orbits. For Orthographic, Orthorectified, and Vertical projections, this optional keyword specifies the point on the projection plane that serves as the origin of the projection (i.e. all points on a line through this point in the direction of PROJECTION_Z_AXIS_VECTOR will be located at X=Y=0 in the projection). If not present, (0,0,0) should be assumed. This translation is generally not necessary and not often used; the (X|Y)_AXIS_MINIMUM and (X|Y)_AXIS_MAXIMUM fields allow the mosaic to be located arbitrarily in the projection plane.

For Orthographic, Orthorectified, and Vertical projections, this vector defines the projection axis for the mosaic. All points along a line parallel to this axis are projected to the same spot in the projection plane. For the Cylindrical-Perspective projections, this defines the new axis of the circle around which the synthetic camera orbits (i.e. the normal to the circle), after the cameras have been rotated to correct for rover tilt. Vector_Projection_Z_Axis_Initial contains the axis before rotation; the difference in these two indicate the rotation amount.

   name                   Ring_Polar
   description            The representation of ring data requires a unique projection. The rings are modeled by a thin disk centered on the body and in its equatorial plane. For Saturn, the thin disk is centered on Saturn and in its equatorial plane, with an outer radius of 500,000km. If the field of view falls partially or completely beyond this limit or if it intersects the primary body before intersecting the rings, the data will not be included. Plotted coordinates are derived as follows. If A is the location of the intersection of the CIRS field of view with the body's equatorial plane, the X coordinate is the distance of A from the center of the body (e.g. Saturn), and the Y coordinate is the local time on on the body at the intersection with the body's surface of the line between A and the body's center. Local time is expressed in fractional hours, from 0.0 (at midnight) to 12.0 (at noon), to 24.0 (at midnight).

   name                   Geo_Transformation
   description            The GEO_Transformation describes the relationship between raster positions (in pixel/line coordinates) and georeferenced coordinates. This is defined by an affine transform. The affine transform consists of six coefficients which map pixel/line coordinates into georeferenced space using the following relationship: Xgeo = GT(0) + Xpixel*GT(1) + Yline*GT(2) Ygeo = GT(3) + Xpixel*GT(4) + Yline*GT(5) or also defined as: GT[0] = Xmin; // upperleft_corner_y GT[1] = CellSize in X; // W-E pixel size, pixel_resolution_x GT[2] = 0; // rotation term, 0 if 'North Up' GT[3] = Ymax; // upperleft_corner_y GT[4] = 0; // shear term, 0 if 'North Up' GT[5] = CellSize in Y; // N-S pixel size, pixel_resolution_y In case of north up images, the GT(2) and GT(4) coefficients are zero, and the GT(1) is pixel width (pixel_resolution_x), and GT(5) is pixel height (pixel_resolution_y). The (GT(0),GT(3)) position is the top left corner of the top left pixel of the raster. Note that the pixel/line coordinates in the above are from (0.5,0.5) at the top left corner of the top left pixel to (width_in_pixels,height_in_pixels) at the bottom right corner of the bottom right pixel. The pixel/line location of the center of the top left pixel would therefore be (1.0,1.0).
