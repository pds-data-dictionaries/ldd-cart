"geom:Quaternion_Base:1               ","Class","Quaternion_Base","1.0.0.0","geom","The Quaternion_Base class defines a quaternion that represents rotation between two right-handed reference frames. In this dictionary, quaternions are always constructed so that the application of the quaternion describes the rotation of one frame to a second frame. The two frames and the direction of rotation must be identified unambiguously in the enclosing classes. Quaternions are expressed as a set of four numbers in the order (qcos, qsin1, qsin2, qsin3), where qcos = cos(theta/2) and qsin(n) = sin(theta/2)*a(n). Theta is the angle of rotation and a is the unit vector (x,y,z) around which the rotation occurs. A document providing the full mathematical basis for this construction, along with examples, and a summary of common pitfalls, is in preparation. The current version can be obtained by contacting the PDS Engineering Node. In application you need to know the four elements of the quaternion, the two end point frames, and the direction of the rotation. This dictionary provides two extensions to this Base class. In the Quaternion_Plus_Direction class we require the direction of rotation. This class can only be used if the two end point frames are identified in the enclosing class. This is generally the case in the Lander section. The Quaternion_Plus_To_From class requires the two frames be identified explicitly with one designated as the "from frame" and the other as the "to frame". ","geo","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given an image, displayed as described by the Display_Direction class, any one of the Object_Orientation_* classes should allow unambiguous orientation of the contents of the image. The Local_Internal_Reference class is used to identify the object to which this instance of the Image_Display_Geometry class applies, and must be used if there is more than one instance of Image_Display_Geometry in the label. The appropriate value for local_reference_type is image_display_to_object. The Object_Orientation_North_East class is typically used for instruments for which the entire field of view is a portion of the target surface (e.g., instruments on Mars orbital spacecraft); otherwise use Object_Orientation_RA_Dec (e.g., flyby missions, missions with orbit radii much larger than the target radius such as Voyager or Cassini). At least one of these must be used. The two *_Identification classes used here are Central_Body (e.g., Saturn if you are using Planetocentric or planetographic coordinates in the Saturn system) and Target when the described object in the FoV is not the Central_Body. For example giving the orientation of the pole of Enceladus in Saturn Planetocentric coordinates, Central_Body = Saturn, Target = Enceladus.
