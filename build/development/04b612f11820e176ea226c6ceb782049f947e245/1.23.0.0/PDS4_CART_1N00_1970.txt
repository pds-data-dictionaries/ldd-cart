   name                   longitude_direction
   version                1.23
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The longitude_direction attribute identifies the direction of longitude (e.g. Positive East or Positive West) for a planet. The IAU definition for direction of positive longitude should be adopted: http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/groups/IAU-WGCCRE. Typically, for planets with prograde (direct) rotations, positive longitude direction is to the west. For planets with retrograde rotations, positive longitude direction is to the east. Generally the Positive West longitude_direction is used for planetographic systems and Positive East is used for planetocentric systems. If the data is defined with Spatial_Domain in a manner not recommended by the IAU, there is a optional Secondary_Spatial_Domain section to define a second set of bounding coordinates such that both Positive East and Positive West bounding coordinates can be provided.

   name                   coordinate_system_type
   version                1.23
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            There are three basic types of coordinate systems: body-fixed rotating, body-fixed non-rotating, and inertial. A body-fixed coordinate system is one associated with the body (e.g., a planet or satellite). The body-fixed system is centered on the body and rotates with the body (unless it is a non-rotating type), whereas an inertial coordinate system is fixed at some point in space. Currently, the PDS has specifically defined two types of body-fixed rotating coordinate systems: planetocentric and planetographic. However, the set of related data elements are modeled such that definitions for other body-fixed rotating coordinate systems, body-fixed non-rotating and inertial coordinate systems can be added as the need arises. Contact a PDS data engineer for assistance in defining a specific coordinate system.

   name                   latitude_type
   version                1.23
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The latitude_type attribute defines the type of latitude (planetographic, planetocentric) used within a cartographic product and as reflected in attribute values within associated PDS labels. For planets and satellites, latitude is measured north and south of the equator; north latitudes are designated as positive. The planetocentric latitude is the angle between the equatorial plane and a line from the center of the body. The planetographic latitude is the angle between the equatorial plane and a line that is normal to the body. In summary, both latitudes are equivalent on a sphere (i.e., equatorial radius equal to polar radius); however, they differ on an ellipsoid (e.g., Mars, Earth). For more on latitude_type, please see the IAU publication available here: http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/groups/IAU-WGCCRE 

   name                   latitude_resolution
   version                1.23
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description            Latitude is the angular distance north or south from the equator. The latitude_resolution attribute indicates the minimum difference between two adjacent latitude values expressed in angular units of measure. For raster data, the value is normally the pixel size in angular units (currently degrees). For vector data (points, lines, polygons), it is a little less concrete and usually indicates the fuzzy tolerance or clustering/streaming setting that establishes the minimum distance at which two points will NOT be automatically merged during data collection. This should also be reported in angular units (currently degrees).

   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description             The pixel_resolution_x and pixel_resolution_y attributes indicate the image array pixel resolution (distance/pixel or degree/pixel) relative to the Cartesian (x,y) coordinate system as defined by the map projection. Due to varying properties across different map projections, actual surface distances for an individual pixel may be accurate only at specific location(s) within the image array (e.g. reference latitude or longitude, standard parallels, etc). For most PDS products, x and y resolution values are equal ('square' pixels). The inclusion of both x and y attributes allows for anticipated products where resolution may differ for each axis ('rectangular' pixels). NOTE: Definition of this PDS4 attribute differs from how 'resolution' was defined within PDS3.

   description             The pixel_scale_x and pixel_scale_y attributes indicate the image array pixel scale (pixel/degree or pixel/distance) relative to the Cartesian (x,y) coordinate system as defined by the map projection. Due to varying properties across different map projections, actual surface distances for an individual pixel may be accurate only at specific location(s) within the image array (e.g. reference latitude or longitude, standard parallels, etc). For most PDS products, x and y scale values are equal ('square' pixels). The inclusion of both x and y attributes allows for anticipated products where scale may differ for each axis ('rectangular' pixels). NOTE 1: For presentation of hard-copy maps, a map scale is traditionally expressed as a 'representative fraction' (the ratio of a hard-copy map to the actual subject surface (e.g. 1:250,000, where one unit of measure on the map equals 250,000 of the same unit on the body surface)). This usage is relevant when map/data are presented on hard-copy media (paper, computer screen,etc). When defining pixel scale within a stored image/array context here, we are expressing a ratio between the image array and the actual surface (thus, pixel/degree or pixel/distance units).

Unit vector in the direction of the X axis of the oblique coordinate system used in the Oblique Cylindrical projection, in terms of the X, Y, and Z axes of the standard body-fixed coordinate system. In each system, the X axis points from the body center toward longitude and latitude (0,0) in that system, the Z axis to (0,90), and the Y-axis completes a right-handed set. The oblique_proj_x/y/z_axis_vector(s) make up the rows of a rotation matrix that when multiplied on the left of a vector referenced to the standard coordinate system converts it into its equivalent in the oblique coordinate system. This rotation matrix is the product of successively applied rotations by oblique_proj_pole_longitude around the Z axis, 90 oblique_proj_pole_latitude around the once-rotated Y axis, and oblique_proj_pole_rotation around the twice-rotated Z axis.

Unit vector in the direction of the Y axis of the oblique coordinate system used in the Oblique Cylindrical projection, in terms of the X, Y, and Z axes of the standard body-fixed coordinate system. In each system, the X axis points from the body center toward longitude and latitude (0,0) in that system, the Z axis to (0,90), and the Y-axis completes a right-handed set. The oblique_proj_x/y/z_axis_vector(s) make up the rows of a rotation matrix that when multiplied on the left of a vector referenced to the standard coordinate system converts it into its equivalent in the oblique coordinate system. This rotation matrix is the product of successively applied rotations by oblique_proj_pole_longitude around the Z axis, 90 oblique_proj_pole_latitude around the once-rotated Y axis, and oblique_proj_pole_rotation around the twice-rotated Z axis.

   description            The value (Right, Left or Both) indicates the side of the spacecraft ground-track to which the antenna is pointed for data acquired within this file. The SAR (synthetic aperture radar) images stored in the BIDR (basic image data record) files are always acquired on only one side of the ground-track for each Titan pass. This value also indicates from which side the SAR image is illuminated. If the spacecraft images to the left of its ground-track (look_direction=Left), the image will be illuminated from the (viewer's) left side, and, conversely, if the spacecraft looks to the right, the illumination will come from the right in the image file. The direction of illumination is critical to interpretation of features in the image.

Here we define latitude_of_projection_origin as mandatory and at CART LDD version 1934 have made scale_factor_at_projection_origin optional. For context, these two keywords have the same impact on the final product but are just different ways to define it. Thus, for example in the PROJ library, if both are made available, the latitude_of_projection_origin (+lat_ts) will be used instead of scale_factor_at_projection_origin (+k_0). Note, if you do supply the optional attribute scale_factor_at_projection_origin, the default scale (+k_0) for planetary polar data will mostly likely be set to 1.0.

   name                   Vector_Projection_Origin
   description            The Vector_Projection_Origin class specifies the location of the origin of the projection. For Polar and Cylindrical projections, this is the XYZ point from which all the azimuth/elevation rays emanate. For the Cylindrical-Perspective projection, this defines the center of the circle around which the synthetic camera orbits. For Orthographic, Orthorectified, and Vertical projections, this optional keyword specifies the point on the projection plane that serves as the origin of the projection (i.e. all points on a line through this point in the direction of PROJECTION_Z_AXIS_VECTOR will be located at X=Y=0 in the projection). If not present, (0,0,0) should be assumed. This translation is generally not necessary and not often used; the (X|Y)_AXIS_MINIMUM and (X|Y)_AXIS_MAXIMUM fields allow the mosaic to be located arbitrarily in the projection plane.

   description            The Vector_Projection_Z_Axis class specifies a unit vector defining the Z axis for a given projection. For Orthographic, Orthorectified, and Vertical projections, this vector defines the projection axis for the mosaic. All points along a line parallel to this axis are projected to the same spot in the projection plane. For the Cylindrical-Perspective projections, this defines the new axis of the circle around which the synthetic camera orbits (i.e. the normal to the circle), after the cameras have been rotated to correct for rover tilt. Vector_Projection_Z_Axis_Initial contains the axis before rotation; the difference in these two indicate the rotation amount.

   name                   Ring_Polar
   description            The representation of ring data requires a unique projection. The rings are modeled by a thin disk centered on the body and in its equatorial plane. For Saturn, the thin disk is centered on Saturn and in its equatorial plane, with an outer radius of 500,000km. If the field of view falls partially or completely beyond this limit or if it intersects the primary body before intersecting the rings, the data will not be included. Plotted coordinates are derived as follows. If A is the location of the intersection of the CIRS field of view with the body's equatorial plane, the X coordinate is the distance of A from the center of the body (e.g. Saturn), and the Y coordinate is the local time on on the body at the intersection with the body's surface of the line between A and the body's center. Local time is expressed in fractional hours, from 0.0 (at midnight) to 12.0 (at noon), to 24.0 (at midnight).

   name                   Geo_Transformation
   description            The Geo_Transformation describes the relationship between raster positions (in pixel/line coordinates) and georeferenced coordinates. This is defined by an affine transform. The affine transform consists of six coefficients which map pixel/line coordinates into georeferenced space using the following relationship: Xgeo = GT(0) + Xpixel*GT(1) + Yline*GT(2) Ygeo = GT(3) + Xpixel*GT(4) + Yline*GT(5) or also defined as: GT[0] = Xmin; // upperleft_corner_y GT[1] = CellSize in X; // W-E pixel size, pixel_resolution_x GT[2] = 0; // rotation term, 0 if 'North Up' GT[3] = Ymax; // upperleft_corner_y GT[4] = 0; // shear term, 0 if 'North Up' GT[5] = CellSize in Y; // N-S pixel size, pixel_resolution_y In case of north up images, the GT(2) and GT(4) coefficients are zero, and the GT(1) is pixel width (pixel_resolution_x), and GT(5) is pixel height (pixel_resolution_y). The (GT(0),GT(3)) position is the top left corner of the top left pixel of the raster. Note that the pixel/line coordinates in the above are from (0.5,0.5) at the top left corner of the top left pixel to (width_in_pixels,height_in_pixels) at the bottom right corner of the bottom right pixel. The pixel/line location of the center of the top left pixel would therefore be (1.0,1.0).
