# LDD Source Directory

This directory should contain one IngestLDD for the LDD being built. The auto-generation script does not currently support multiple versions of an LDD being maintained.

See the [tutorial on updating and building an IngestLDD](https://pds-data-dictionaries.github.io/support/tutorials.html#ldd-update-and-build-tutorial) and the [LDD Update Process](https://pds-data-dictionaries.github.io/development/ldd-update.html) for more details.
